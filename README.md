# alias-gen

The idea behind this script is that we have many git repos (dozens of them) working in an environment that embrace microservices.
As a result, we have many folders under the workspace.
It becomes time consuming simply switching from one git repo to another.
This script is for generating a shortcut for opening repo from the command line.
For example, if you have a repo called `Mumbai`, you can simply switch to that repo by typing `go2_mumbai` in your terminal regardless where you are. 

## Environment

We use `conda` for managing environment here. Cheat sheet for create, update, and sharing.

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda env update -f environment.yml
    conda env export --no-builds | grep -v "prefix" > environment_freeze.yml

## Usage

Activate environment and run `alias_gen`.

    conda activate alias_gen
    python alias_gen.py

It which will then generate a file `~/.alias-gen`.

	#
	# Generated by alia-gen.py
	#
	alias detroit="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Detroit"
	alias draggablepanel="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/DraggablePanel"
	alias durham="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Durham"
	alias helpers="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Helpers"
	alias mountainview="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/MountainView"
	alias mumbai="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Mumbai"
	# Skiping directory 'RxSwift_Reactive_Programming_with_Swift_v2.0' because it is not a git repo
	alias seattle="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Seattle"
	alias springfield="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Springfield"

You can add `--dry-run` to see the output before saving the output to file.

And finally add this to `~/.bash_profile` so that it updates automatically.

	# Added for generating alias for navigating to git repos
	if [ -f ~/.alias_gen ]; then 
	    . ~/.alias_gen;
	fi
