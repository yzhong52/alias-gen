# alias-gen

The idea behind this script is that we have many git repos (dozens of them) working in an environment that embrace microservices. As a result, we have many folders under the workspace. It becomes time consuming simply switching from one git repo to another. This script is for generating a shortcut for opening repo from the command line. For example, if you have a repo called `Mumbai`, you can simply switch to that repo by typing `mumbai` in your terminal regardless where you are. 

Use it like this:

    conda env create -f environment.yml # Replace `create` with `update` after the first run
    source activate alias_gen
    python alias_gen.py

Or without conda:

	pip3 install gitpython
	python3 alias_gen.py

which will then generate a file `~/.alias-gen`:

	#
	# Generated by alia-gen.py
	#
	alias detroit="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Detroit"
	alias draggablepanel="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/DraggablePanel"
	alias durham="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Durham"
	alias helpers="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Helpers"
	alias mountainview="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/MountainView"
	alias mumbai="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Mumbai"
	# Skiping directory 'RxSwift_Reactive_Programming_with_Swift_v2.0' because it is not a git repo
	alias seattle="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Seattle"
	alias springfield="cd /Users/yuchen/Documents/Springfield"

And finally add this to `~/.bash_profile`:

	# Added by Yuchen for using generated alias!
	if [ -f ~/.alias_gen ]; then 
	    . ~/.alias_gen;
	fi
